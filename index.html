            <p class="lead">GitHub is a web based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. Github offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and a lot of features where you can collaborate this includes bug tracking, feature requests, and task management for every one of your projects. Github provides you with options for both private and free repositories on the same account, this is commonly used to host open source software projects. As of the date April 2016 Github estimates having more than 14 million users and up to 35 million repositories, this makes it the largest host of source code in the world.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git add updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It usually adds the current content of the existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that don't exist in the working tree anymore. The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it's this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. So after making the changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or moddified files to the index.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git log helps you review the backups created in the repository. There is also git log HEAD which means to show you all of the commits reachable from the current HEAD, where the next commit will attach. There are also other forms of Git log like git log origin/master which means you get the commits from the remote but don't update any of the local branches. You can use an extention of git log called git pull and that will fetch and then merge your branch with what it fetched. It's always a good idea to fetch, inspect what was done and then merge or rebase or even reject what was done with a force push. Then you can combine both of those for a Git log Head origin/master this is when the operator is short hand for combining "exclude reachable commits from this reference.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a component of software configuration management, version control is also known as revision control or source control, it is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information. Changes that are made are usually identified by a specific number or letter code, these are termed the revision number, revision level, or simply revision. Version control systems most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and in various content management systems. Software tools for version control are essential for the organization of multi-developer projects. Version control allows for the ability to revertt a document to a previous revision.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Git is typically used for software development, but it can also be used to keep track of changes in any files. Git is a distrubted revision control system so it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distrubted, non-linear workflows. As with most other distrubted version control systems, and unlike most client server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Since Git is a distrubuted version control system, it can be used as a server out of the box. Dedicated Git server software helps, amongst other features, to add access control.</p>
